    1) Java coding :
    - Check if it's a prime number
    - Same code for below all the problem
           (- Find the sum of first 'N' natural numbers
            - Find the sum of all integers from 1 to n
            - Add all the numbers from 1 to n)
    - Find the sum of the two arrays
    - Search for the given target
    - Reverse the array (Not solved)
    - Check if the given array is in non-decreasing
    - Find the given element
    - Find the smallest num in array
    - Find the total number of students (Not solved)
    - Determine the matrix center (Not solved)
    - Find the diagonal sum (Not solved)
    - Determine the matrix T sum (Not solved)

     What is stack and heap memory
     What is top Array important methods?

 1) What is static and non - static methods ::
 Static methods: Can be called without creating an object of the class, Belong to the class. (Syntax: ClassName.staticMethodName();)
 As we do not required creating object So we can manage memory using static method
 Non-static methods: Require an object of the class to be called, Belong to instances (objects) of the class. (ClassName obj = new ClassName(); obj.nonStaticMethodName();)
 Rule ::
    "static" methods belongs to the class, not to the object.
    "static" method can be accessed directly by class name and doesnâ€™t need any object.
    "static" method can access only static data. It cannot access non-static data (instance data).
    "static" method can call only other static methods and cannot call a non-static method.
    "static" method cannot refer to "this" or "super" keyword in any way.

 2) What is this keyword & why use ::
 this keyword: When a local variable (e.g., method parameter) has the same name as an instance (Class) variable,
                 Java uses the "this" keyword to distinguish the instance variable from the local variable.

 3) What is the use of Super keywords ::
 It is mainly used when the child class has a variable with the same name as the parent class variable, to access the parent variable.
 The 'super' keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class's members (variables, methods, constructor).
 It is commonly used to call the parent class constructor or overridden method.

 4) Explain PS-VM:
 Valid Main Method Signature:
    public static void main(String[] args) : default signature.
    public static void main(String[] arguments) : changing the identifier args to different name.
    static public void main(String[] args) : static and public positions are interchanged.
    public static void main(String []args) : different way of allowed String array declaration.
    public static void main(String args[]) : different way of allowed String array declaration.
    public static void main(String... args) : arrays can be replaced with var arg syntax.

 Invalid Main Method Signature:
    public static void Main(String[] args) : capital M in identifier main
    public static String main(String[] args) : returning String instead of void
    private static void main(String[] args) : changing access modifier
    public static void main(String args) : passing String as an argument instead of String[] array

 5) Access modifiers in java:
 public : What it means: Anyone can access it.
 protected: What it means: Only accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
 default (no modifier): What it means: Only accessible within the same package.
 private: What it means: Only accessible within the same class.

 6) What is parameters and arguments:
 Parameters : String name in greet(String name)
 Arguments : "Akshay" in greet("Akshay")
