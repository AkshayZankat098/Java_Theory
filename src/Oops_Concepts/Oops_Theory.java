// 1. Classes 
// 2. Object 
// 3. Inheritance (Focus on code reusability): Logic of parents and child 
// 4. Polymorphism :
// 	Two Types 
// 		> Method overloading
// 		> Method overriding 
// 5. Encapsulation : Concepts of overriding and overloading
// 6. Abstraction (Focus on code security): 
// 	> Data hiding 
// 	> Encapsulation
// 	> Tightly coupled classes 
// 	How to achieve Abstraction :
// 		> Abstract class

//3) Polymorphism
//4) Encapsulation
//5) Inheritance 
//6) Data Abstraction (abstract classes, interfaces)
//Class : Class is the collection of attribute, Methods, veriables and behaviour 
// In Java, a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects (instances). 
// It defines the properties (fields) & behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. 
// A class in Java is essentially a way to structure and organize data and functionality together.
//Examples : Students & Students names  All classes veriable is assign to object
