    abstract void abstractMethod ();  //No body : Most of the time body of this method is added by child class.

// Abstraction : Hiding the internal implementation from external users  (Example: A car has a drive() method â€” the user just calls drive() but doesn't need to know how the engine, 
// gearbox, or fuel system works and we can not create object of this class.

//Achive Abstraction with two way :: 

// 1) Using abstract class 
// 2) Using interface logic
