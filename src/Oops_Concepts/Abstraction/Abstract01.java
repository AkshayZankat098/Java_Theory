// Abstraction : Hiding the internal implementation from external users  (Example: A car has a drive() method â€” the user just calls drive() but doesn't need to know how the engine, 
// gearbox, or fuel system works and we can not create object of this class.

// 1. What is interfaces ?
// 2. What is abstraction ?
// 3. Types of Polymorphism ?
// 4. What is data abstraction ?
// 5. What is an abstract class?

//Achive Abstraction with two way :: 

// 1) Using abstract class 
// 2) Using interface logic
